Hello! I'm Philippe Boutin, a Full-Stack Embedded Server Architect with a strong background in web development, embedded systems, and IT management. I have over 8 years of experience in the industry, holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and multiple certifications, including Cisco CCNA, Linux Professional Institute (LPI), and CompTIA A+.

Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies, from HTML5 and CSS3 to Python, JavaScript, and SQL. My passion for technology and problem-solving has led me to develop innovative solutions for clients across various industries.

I pride myself on being a versatile professional, able to adapt to new environments and stay updated on the latest industry trends. When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me hiking, practicing photography, or exploring new cuisines.
